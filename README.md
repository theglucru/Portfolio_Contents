# R projects go here

## US-Covid-Cases
### Tracking the progess of COVID-19 in the US and visualizing it using R, and RShiny
Data is taken from The NY Times public dataset located at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

Ideas: 

- Provide visualization of the datasets available
  
- Make an R Shiny app to breakdown each individual state. Code will be in the R Shiny Apps repo
