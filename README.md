## Lichess Elite Database games
### An analysis of the chess games from the [Lichess Elite Database](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
> This is a collection of lichess.org games from https://database.lichess.org/
> I filtered all (standard) games from lichess to only keep games by players rated 2400+ against players rated 2200+, excluding bullet games.

> I believe that the database might be useful for players who want to be up to date on the latest theoretical novelties as strong players test their discoveries online. Another potential use for this database is to see how strong opponents would face your openings in practice.

> I published the Lichess Elite Database from 2013 until May 2020 as a torrent which you can get below (known issue: tournament games from lichess are not included):

Chess Online has surged in popularity during the pandemic. While I was at home, I stumbled upon a YouTube video of people watching chess and making it look entertaining. While I do not play the game at all, I find it very fascinating looking at other people's analysis of games by some of the highest rated players

Data presentation will be in this folder in pdf format
